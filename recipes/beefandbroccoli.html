<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 lbs Ribeye Steak</li>
    <li>1 broccoli crown, rinsed and chopped</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 red or green bell pepper (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup reduced-sodium Kikkoman soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 tbsp honey</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 whole carrot, shredded</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp fish sauce</li>
    <li>2 tsp rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Beef:</strong>
            <br>
            Slice the ribeye steak thinly against the grain. This helps to tenderize the meat.
            Season the sliced beef with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong> Prepare the Sauce:</strong>
            <br>
            In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, honey, minced garlic, fish sauce, rice vinegar,
            and sesame oil. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong> 
            <br>
            Chop the broccoli crown into bite-sized florets.
            Chop the onion and bell pepper (if using) into thin slices.
            Shred the carrot using a grater.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir-Fry:</strong>
            <br>
            Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
            Add the sliced beef to the skillet and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until browned. Remove the beef
            from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Vegetables:</strong>
            <br>
            In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.
            Add the chopped onion and bell pepper (if using) to the skillet. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes 
            until they start to soften.
            Add the broccoli florets and shredded carrot to the skillet. Continue stir-frying for
            another 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine:</strong>
            <br>
            Return the cooked beef to the skillet with the vegetables.
            Pour the prepared sauce over the beef and vegetables in the skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Steps:</strong>
            <br>
            Stir everything together and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly and coats the beef and vegetables evenly.
            Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
            Once everything is heated through and well-coated with the sauce, remove from heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <br>
            Transfer the stir-fry beef and broccoli to a serving dish.
            Serve hot over cooked rice or noodles.</li>
        
    </ol>
