    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, diced</li>
    <li>3 carrots, peeled and chopped into chunks</li>
    <li>3 potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
    <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried rosemary</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>

</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season 
        the chuck roast generously with salt and pepper, then sear it on all 
        sides until browned. Transfer the roast to the slow cooker.</li>
    <li>In the same skillet, add the diced onion, carrots, and potatoes. Cook 
        for 5 minutes until slightly softened. Add minced garlic and cook for 
        an additional minute.</li>
    <li>Transfer the vegetables to the slow cooker, arranging them around the roast.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together beef broth, red wine (if using), tomato paste,
         Worcestershire sauce, dried thyme, and dried rosemary. Pour this mixture over 
         the roast and vegetables in the slow cooker. Add bay leaves for extra flavor.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4-5 hours, until the roast is tender 
        and falls apart easily with a fork.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, remove the roast and vegetables from the slow cooker. Discard bay leaves. 
        If desired, thicken the gravy by mixing 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water, then stirring it into the hot liquid in the slow cooker. Cook on high for an additional 15 minutes until thickened.</li>
    <li>Slice the roast against the grain and serve with the vegetables and gravy. Enjoy your
        delicious and comforting pot roast!</li>
